How to deploy Faish
=================

Do this in order:

Make a new 64-bit image using VisualWorks 8.3 (unfortunately, the WebSupport doesn't support 7.10.)
UI look: WIndows 98/2000, feel: MS Windows, make sure the right mouse button is <operate>.
File in:
	Faish.st
		- in the debugger that pops up, execute "FaishVariable initialize", restart from FaishVariable class>>from:.
	Faish-UserInterface.st
	Faish-Evolution.st
Edit the "About" box:
	Go to FaishModuleListUI>>aboutAction and put some good text in there.
Parcel manager; load packages named:
	Networking / WebSupport
	Deploying Applications / RuntimePackager
Tools -> Runtime Packager:
	Next
	"Clean up image" - do this step, then next.
	"Set common options" - do this step
		Start-up class is "FaishModuleListUI"
		Start-up method is "openSingleton"
		Runtime image name is "faish"
		"Okay", back to Runtime Packager, "Next".
	"Specify classes and methods to keep", do this step:
		Keep all "Faish-*" packages.
		Keep "ExternalWebBrowser"
	"Scan for unreferenced items" - do this step.
	next
	" Test application"
		Add URL repository "http://www.squl.org/repo/" (Load -> Edit Repositories -> New URL)
		Reload repositories (uses network stuff).
		Load a module (uses MD5).
		Load help (uses ExternalWebBrowser)
		Commit the image (uses Kernel.XMLSourceFileFormat)
		Remove all modules and repositories you added.
		Close the main window, discard changes.
	next (there's no need to change memory params)
	"Strip and save image" - make sure all Faish windows are closed and do this.
		
Grab faish.im, faish.sh, visual, faish.exe, put them in a directory together and zip it up: 

$ zip "Faish 0.3.zip" -R "Faish 0.3"/*
