Creating an AGI using Squl
=============================

The end goal of Squl / Faish is to create an AGI. My definition of an AGI is that a reinforcement learning algorithm. The value function that it would follow could be arbitrarily complex, possibly based on neural networks or other advanced categorisation algorithm.

Furthermore, parts of the AGI would later be useful for other AI projects.

The basic algorithm
-------------------

Environment -> Actions -> Reward -> New behaviour

The AGI would:

* Form concepts. It would summarise its environment over time. Concepts are discrete objects.

* Determine cause and effect through observation. Which actions cause which rewards? Which environmental phenomena cause other phenomena?

Cause and effect could be:

* discrete, where one concept causes another.

* continuous. A behaviour can be described by a mathematical relationship.

Concepts are evaluated by their usefulness. If they are not used, they are forgotten. Eventually, usefulness is determined by whatever helps attain a reward.

Models and Predictions
----------------------

The AGI wants to make predictions about the future:

* What will happen after an event occurs.

* What will happen if I perform particular actions.

It will make models of its environment. A model can be:

* a mathematical formula describing properties of phenomena.

* a mathematical formula describing a relationship between two events.

A model's usefulness would be used to determine whether it would be kept. An evolutionary algorithm can be used to generate models. Usefulness is measured by whether the model helped generate a reward.

Models are also lossy summaries of the environment. 

The blurry photograph algorithm can be used to measure the accuracy of a model.

Planning
---------

Actions are not returned directly but as part of a plan.

The difficulty is to have general ambiguous strategies without planning every action in advance.

Attention
---------


Novelty preference
---------

Novelty preference is 

Emotion
--------

The algorithms used have many parameters. Collectively, we know these as emotions. 

Past experience and context
---------

Phenomena are first categorised before formula are derived. Formula and evoltion strategies are based on this caregorisation.

TODO: how to make categories of experience?

When the world gets too large, environments can be caregorised. Environmental contexts are used to manage resources and pre-load data.

Cause/effect can be used to predict changes in context.


Examples
---------

Balancing pole: ai observes path of pole, derives mathematical formula to explain it. Formula is exploited to plan actions.

The formula could be derived starting with past experience.
