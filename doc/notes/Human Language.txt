Human Language

This is an idea for a human language based on Squl. For now, we reuse English vocabulary.

Sentences are (Subject Verb Object). The verb specifies a relationship. The verb is never 'is', which is too overloaded. Verbs use their english present tense.

    john give bone

Tense is used as a prefix to a sentence and applies to the whole sentense. Tense can be 'did', 'now', 'will' for past, present and future.

    did john give bone
    did (john give bone)

Specifiers are prefixes. 'a', 'the', 'this', 'that', 'few', 'many', 'all', 'none', 'exists'. 'few' and 'many' also mean 'some' and 'much'.

    did john give bone
    did (john give (the bone)).

'all' is synonymous with 'for all'. 'exists' is synonymous with 'there exists'. I'm not sure how variables will use these.

Connectives are logical ('and', 'or', 'xor', 'causes', 'then' (time), ) and are infix. 'not' is postfix. 'or' is not exclusive; 'xor' is exclusive.

    did john give the bone causes now dog hungry.
    (did (john give (the bone))) causes (now (dog hungry))

Extra bits of information can be appended to a sentence to clarify it's meaning. These all start with a modifier ('in', 'to', 'with', etc). These take the original sentence as an argument and are that sentence with modifiers.

    did ((john drive) (in car) (to market)).

Questions are made using variables.

   john drive in car to market atTime X.
   john drive in X.

Variables can also be used in statements where several parts of the sentence are the same thing.

Commands are done using variables:

   you drive in car to market atTime now+5 minutes.

Pronouns are the same as english: me, you, he, they.
 
'and' is only a logical connective. Collections are added to using other operators (with, without, union, intersection).

events? 
'the concept of'
How do you say:
Did something happen?


adjectives? adverbs?
